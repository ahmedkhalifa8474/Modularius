# Key Features:

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks module loading events, providing immediate alerts for suspicious or known vulnerable modules.

Vulnerability Detection: Flags modules that match predefined known vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated drivers or compromised DLLs).

Suspicious Path Detection: Identifies modules loaded from untrusted or unexpected paths, providing early warnings of potential attacks.

Comprehensive Logging: Records detailed logs of all detected events, offering a full audit trail for security investigations.

System Protection: By detecting malicious modules early, ModTector enhances the security posture of your system, reducing the risk of exploitation through module-based attacks.

Whether you're safeguarding a critical server or monitoring a user workstation, ModTector acts as your first line of defense, providing proactive protection against the growing threat of module-based vulnerabilities.
